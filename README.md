# sclork-quneo

## Introduction
sclork-quneo is a QuNeo related project for [Santa Clara Laptop Orchestra (SCLOrk)](https://www.scu.edu/cas/music/ensembles/sclork/).

sclork-quneo is a GUI for [QuNeo](https://www.keithmcmillen.com/products/quneo/) which implements mirror functionality. 
This means all actions performed on the QuNeo will reflect on the GUI on your laptop screen and vice versa. 

As SCLOrk's first technical intern, I will be documenting my journey here! 

## Technologies:
* [SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider): a platform for audio synthesis written in C++
* [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)): a toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI) written in C++
* [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B): general-purpose programming language

## Timeline:

I began this project in mid-August 2019. A week in and the UI is in good shape:

Now, I will be focusing on building the mirror class!
