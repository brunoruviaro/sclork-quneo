# sclork-quneo
sclork-quneo is a QuNeo related project for Santa Clara Laptop Orchestra (SCLOrk).
sclork-quneo is a GUI for [QuNeo](https://www.keithmcmillen.com/products/quneo/) which implements mirror functionality. 
This means all actions performed on the QuNeo will reflect on the GUI on your laptop screen and vice versa. 

As SCLOrk's first technical intern, I will be documenting my journey here!
